# Trigger Word Detection

This repository contains my implementation of a trigger word detection algorithm using deep learning. The model is trained on a dataset of synthesized speech samples, including both positive (trigger word present) and negative (trigger word not present) samples.

## Approach

The model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), where each layer consists of a convolutional layer followed by a max pooling layer. The CNN learns to extract features from the input audio signal, which are then used to predict whether or not the trigger word is present.

## Results

The model demonstrates high accuracy in real-time trigger word detection, even in noisy environments.

## Usage

You can employ the model to develop various applications, including:

- A voice-activated assistant
- A voice-controlled smart home system
- A voice-triggered event recorder

## Extending the Algorithm

Once you've trained the trigger word detection algorithm, you can use it to trigger a variety of events such as:

- Starting up an app on your computer
- Turning on a smart light in your house
- Playing music
- Sending a text message
- Posting a status update on social media
- Turning on the TV
- Adjusting the thermostat
- Opening the garage door

To achieve this, you would need to integrate your trigger word detection algorithm with another software application or service that can control the devices or services you want to trigger. For example, you could use the IFTTT platform to connect your trigger word detection algorithm to a variety of smart home devices and services.
